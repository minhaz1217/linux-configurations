Remember to make the sure "public_key.ppk" file 

# if you want to make it read only by you
chmod 400 keys/public_key.ppk 

# if you want to make it read and write only by you
chmod 600 keys/public_key.ppk 

And check permission with 
ls -l keys

test the connection to the server with
ansible all -m ping
